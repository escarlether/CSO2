GNU General Public License: This license allows any user to freely use and
change this software without any limitations or restrictions. I did not choose this because
I thought that it was not simple enough and no one would want to read it.

The 3-Clause BSD License: This license is simple and clearly communicates the essential
information that encompasses a free piece of software. I chose this license because of its
simplicity and because it included a protective statement for the copyright holder.

Boost Software License: This licese is very similar to the previous two but it mainly
focuses on allowing anyone to use the software without restrictionn instead of protecting
me as the copyright holder. I did not choose this because I do not want to be liable for
anything that someone else makes with this code.
